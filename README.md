Exploring Bitcoin's Journey: A Deep Dive Analysis
**Introduction:**
Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this project, I present a comprehensive analysis of historical Bitcoin market data spanning from December 2011 to March 2021. This dataset, generously provided by Quantum Analytics, has been meticulously cleaned and analyzed to uncover significant trends and insights in the world of cryptocurrencies using Tableau Visualisation tool.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset contains minute-by-minute updates on Bitcoin's OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) prices, as well as trade volumes in BTC and various currencies. With over 1.5 million rows of data, this dataset offers a deep dive into Bitcoin's evolution and the broader landscape of digital assets.

**Data Cleaning Process:**
Ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the data was paramount to our analysis. The data cleaning process was conducted using the Python programming language. Here's an overview of the steps involved:

Unix Timestamp Conversion: The dataset initially included timestamps in Unix time format. We converted these Unix timestamps to standard datetime format, providing a more accessible timeline for analysis.

Handling Null Values: Due to the dataset's size, null values were present in various columns. To maintain the dataset's integrity, we systematically removed all null values, ensuring consistency and reliability in our analysis.

Data Validation: Rigorous validation processes were implemented to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or outliers, ensuring the dataset's accuracy.

**How to Use this Repository:**
Review Data Cleaning Scripts: The 'DataCleaningScripts' directory contains Python scripts detailing the cleaning process step by step. Feel free to explore these scripts to understand the data preparation process thoroughly.
Feedback and Contributions:
I welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the open-source community. If you have insights to share, ideas for further analysis, or improvements to the data cleaning process, please create issues or pull requests. Your collaboration enhances the depth and quality of this research project.

Thank you for your interest in my exploration of Bitcoin's journey. Let's continue uncovering the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies together!

Happy Analyzing!
